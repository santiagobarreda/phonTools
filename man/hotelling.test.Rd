\title{Hotelling's T2 Test}
\usage{
hotelling.test(matrix1, matrix2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix1}{A numeric matrix or dataframe in which each row represents an
observation of a multivariate random variable, and each column represents a
dimension of that variable.}

\item{matrix2}{An optional second numeric matrix or dataframe of the same
column rank as 'matrix1'.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'Hotelling.test', a list containing the elements:

\item{f.value}{The value of the test statistic.} \item{df1}{The numerator
degrees of freedom for the F statistic.} \item{df2}{The denominator degrees
of freedom for the F statistic} \item{p.value}{The p-value for the test.}
\item{samples}{The number of independent samples involved in the test.}
}
\description{
Hotelling's T2 test for one and two samples.
}
\details{
If a single matrix is provided, this function tests the alternative
hypothesis that all column means are not equal to zero. If a second matrix
is provided, the alternative hypothesis to be tested is that the group means
are not all equal. The statistic is tested using an F-distribution which
assumes that the matrices represent (roughly) multivariate normal variables.

This function is only designed for multivariate tests of location. If a
univariate test is desired, please use a t-test.

\examples{

## load Peterson & Barney data
data (pb52)

## separate the Peterson & Barney vowels by speaker
## gender and age (child vs. adult)
men = pb52[pb52$sex == 'm' & pb52$type == 'm',]
women = pb52[pb52$sex == 'f' & pb52$type == 'w',]
boys = pb52[pb52$sex == 'm' & pb52$type == 'c',]
girls = pb52[pb52$sex == 'f' & pb52$type == 'c',]

## fit 4 separate models which predict F1 frequency 
## on the basis of vowel category. 
men = rcr (f1 ~ vowel, men$speaker, men)
women = rcr (f1 ~ vowel, women$speaker, women)
boys = rcr (f1 ~ vowel, boys$speaker, boys)
girls = rcr (f1 ~ vowel, girls$speaker, girls)

## A Hotelling T2 test indicates that there are 
## significant differences in F1 frequency 
## based on vowel category between males and females
hotelling.test (men$coefficients, women$coefficients)

## but no significant differences based on the same 
## criteria between boys and girls.
hotelling.test (boys$coefficients, girls$coefficients)
